    iv.InvoiceDate, 
    c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS FullName, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT iv.InvoiceId) AS TotalPurchases, 
    AVG(inv.UnitPrice * inv.Quantity) AS AvgTotalSales, 
    MAX(iv.InvoiceDate) AS LastPurchaseDate,
    c.CustomerId,
    STRFTIME('%Y', iv.InvoiceDate) AS Year, 
    COUNT(t.TrackId) AS TracksSold,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY STRFTIME('%Y', iv.InvoiceDate) ORDER BY COUNT(t.TrackId) DESC) AS Rank, 
    g.Name AS GenreName
FROM artists AS ar
LEFT JOIN albums AS a ON ar.ArtistId = a.ArtistId
LEFT JOIN tracks AS t ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN invoice_items AS inv ON t.TrackId = inv.TrackId
LEFT JOIN invoices AS iv ON inv.InvoiceId = iv.InvoiceId
RIGHT JOIN customers AS c ON c.CustomerId = iv.CustomerId
